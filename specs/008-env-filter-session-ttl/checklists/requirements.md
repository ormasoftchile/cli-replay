# Specification Quality Checklist: Environment Variable Filtering & Session TTL

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-07  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items passed validation on first iteration.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed. Reasonable defaults were applied for:
  - Duration format (Go `time.ParseDuration` conventions, consistent with existing `delay` field)
  - Glob matching semantics (simple prefix/suffix wildcards, not filesystem glob)
  - Cleanup scope (limited to `.cli-replay/` directories only)
  - Internal variable exemption (`CLI_REPLAY_*` always bypasses deny filters)
- These defaults are documented in the Assumptions section of the spec.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
